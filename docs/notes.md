### 1. Biggest Docker Problem Faced
The biggest problem I faced during this assignment was downloading Docker images.
Due to a slow internet connection, pulling the Docker base image took a very long time.
At some points, it felt like the download would never finish 😅.
This issue was solved by being patient, retrying the build process, and making sure the internet connection was stable.

### 2. Most Important Git/GitHub Lesson Learned
The most important lesson I learned from this assignment was how to manage a project properly using Git and GitHub.
I learned how important it is to organize files, use clear commit messages, and document the project so that anyone can run it easily
